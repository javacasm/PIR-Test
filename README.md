### [Componente](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/10-pcs-Mini-IR-Pyroelectric-Infrared-PIR-Motion-Human-Sensor-Automatic-Detector-Module-AM312-Sensor-DC/32831139174.html)

Product Features:
1. Low power consumption, small size, easy to install
2. Internal use of digital signal processing, pit interference strong
3. High sensitivity, reliability, and can be widely used in automatic sensing circuit
4. Repeatable trigger mode: that is, after the induction output is high, in the delay period, if the body in its induction range of activities, the output will remain high until the delay after the person to become Low level.  (Ie, the sensing module automatically detects a delay period after each activity of the human body, and takes the last active time as the starting point for the delay time).
